        Kirstie is a research fellow at the Alan Turing Institute (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the
        University of Cambridge. Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent
        people and people with mental health conditions. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and
        participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues. She is the lead developer
        of The Turing Way, an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science
        'open for all' by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative
        working. She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 Mozilla Fellow for Science. Kirstie
        was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a 2016 Global Thinker by Foreign Policy magazine.
